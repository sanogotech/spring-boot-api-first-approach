= Spring Boot: API First Approach

This is a sample code on how you can work with API first approach.
In this I use the API contract (based on Open API 3 standards) for creating client and server side code.

The maven plugin that I have used here is the `Open API generator plugin` from https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/plugins[here]

* https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/plugins/

It has support for various languages and also various ways of creating your client or server code.

There are various customization options available that you can use, which you can checkout  at the GitHub link https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin[here]

In this sample, I have used `spring` generator for server side generation and `java` for  client side code generation.

== About the application
Its a simple application , wherein you can trigger the client to server communication using another API.

This is just to demostrate, how the client and server code is generated and how you use it in the application.
